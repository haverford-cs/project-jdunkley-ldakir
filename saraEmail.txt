Hi Jocelyn and Lamiaa ,Apologies for the delay getting you feedback .Ê I love the dataset and don't foresee any issues .Ê A few comments :- For your presentation , I think it will be important to explain the features .Ê Are these words , capitalization , etc ?Ê It would also be very interesting to do a feature analysis to see which features are most helpful for predicting the output ( and if these change across methods ) .- I also think it will be important to talk about previous work on this dataset .- I think your investigation of hyper - parameters is a great idea.Ê For this part , you probably have enough data to do a proper cross-validation , even if the number of folds is low .- For the NN method , I would probably recommend using a FC architecture unless there are some features that would benefit from a convolutional layer .- Runtime might also be worth noting / comparing .Thank you !Ê Looking forward to the results .Ê All the best ,- Sara
