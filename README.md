Our final project was an implementation to see which algorithm would be the most accurate to determine if an email is spam or not. We implemented Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes and Fully Connected Neural Networks. It turned out that Random Forests and AdaBoost had the best/comparable accuracies but AdaBoost correctly predicted a real spam email while Random Forests classifed it as not spam.
